A few points of focus:
  * Doing the course on Coursera of [Andrew Ng][@andrewyng] ["Machine Learning by Stanford University"][ml-course]
  * Creating my personal website

This is a "now page" which itemizes the work and other priorities that I'm 
concentrating on right now. It's built in the style pioneered by Sivers.
